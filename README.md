2048 Game
This is a clone of the popular game "2048" that I created using Visual Studio Code.

About 2048
2048 is a classic puzzle game in which the goal is to combine numbered tiles on a grid to create a tile with the number 2048. The game is played on a 4x4 grid, and you can move tiles in four directions: up, down, left, and right. When two tiles with the same number collide while moving in one of these directions, they merge into a single tile with the sum of their values. The game is won when you create a tile with the number 2048, but you can keep playing to achieve higher scores.

How to Play
Clone the Repository: To play this 2048 game, start by cloning this repository to your local machine using Git.

git clone <repository_url>

Game Controls: You can control the game using your keyboard arrow keys:
Up Arrow: Move tiles upwards.
Down Arrow: Move tiles downwards.
Left Arrow: Move tiles to the left.
Right Arrow: Move tiles to the right.
Gameplay: The game starts with two random tiles of either 2 or 4 on the grid. Your objective is to combine tiles with the same number by moving them in the desired direction. After each move, a new tile will appear on the board with a value of 2 or 4. Try to combine tiles strategically to reach the tile with the number 2048.

Winning: You win the game when you successfully create a tile with the number 2048. However, the game doesn't stop there, and you can continue playing to achieve a higher score.

Scoring: Your score is displayed at the top of the game screen, and it increases every time you combine tiles. Try to achieve the highest score possible!

Game Over: The game ends when there are no valid moves left (i.e., you can't merge any more tiles or move any further). At this point, your final score will be displayed, and you can choose to restart the game and try to beat your previous score.

Restart: To restart the game at any time, simply refresh the page in your web browser.
